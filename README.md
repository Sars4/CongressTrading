# Data problems:
The data for stock trading in Congress was very hard to find in a raw format, hint why I had to create a python script to put together part of the data. For the information that I did find, it was not very satisfactory and it would be better to write a whole web scrapper to find more trades, attributes, and other things. The data only views trades from 2020 and partial trades in 2019 and 2021. I believe it did not cover all trades, while I do think it gets a pretty good idea of the overall trades it would have been better to include more data points. While I was able to deal with incorrect information in the original dataset I think web scrapping would be the way to go.
